# window_test

This is just an application that opens a window, it is mainly to test that you
have installed the core libraries properly, and that you are able to support
OpenGL 3.3 (which you probably almost certainly should be able to). If the
window fails to open/program doesn't compile/whatever please tell me! I'll try
my best to troubleshoot.
